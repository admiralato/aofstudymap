    <string name="article_one_title">I. TRIUNE GOD</string>
    <string name="triuneGodContent">This article is both the beginning and the end of our faith. We believe in ONE eternal and infinite God. He created the universe out of nothing. He was before the world existed. He is and will always be. He has three facets Father, Son and Holy Spirit, which are illustrated through the triangle.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_jesus_christ">JesusChristActivity</string>
    <string name="jesus_christ_article">II. JESUS CHRIST</string>
    <string name="jesusChristContent">God sent His Son, Jesus Christ, from heaven to earth. He was eternally with the Father, and became man by the power of the Holy Spirit and was born of the Virgin Mary. He was fully God and fully man. He is presented as kneeling because he came as a servant, to teach us how much God loves humanity.</string>

    <string name="holy_spirit_article">III. HOLY SPIRIT</string>
    <string name="holySpiritContent">Represented by a dove, the image describes His coming on Jesus at His baptism. A dove is white, expressing the purity of the Holy Spirit. A purity and holiness that He can communicate to those who welcome Him. The Holy Spirit works with and through the Church of Christ, convincing the world of sin, regenerating those who repent and believe, sanctifying believers, and guiding into all truth as it is in Jesus.</string>

    <string name="holyScripturesContent">This image of a book represents the Holy Scriptures as the written Word of God, while Jesus is the Living Word of God. In Scriptures, we learn how God created the world and has invited all humans to a deep communion with Him. With the help of the Holy Spirit, these books of the Old and New Testament teach us the will of God concerning us in all that is necessary to our salvation. The Holy Scriptures give testimony about who God is and the path that leads from sin to salvation.

    <string name="articleFiveToTenTitle">ARTICLES 5-10</string>
    <string name="articlesFiveToTenContent">Articles 5 through 10 describe how each human is invited to move from sin to holiness. From separation from God and death to a full communion with God that promises eternal life. The links between these six pictures witness to the fact that it is the path of humanity. Articles 5 and 6 deal with Adam and Jesus and the curse that comes from the original sin and the blessing that comes from the atonement through Jesus blood . Articles 7 to 10 show us how we can receive by obedient faith, all the blessings of this atonement in our lives. Thanks to God\'s prevenient grace, and through our repentance these blessings include justification and entire sanctification.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_sin_article">SinArticleActivity</string>
    <string name="sinArticleTitle">V. SIN, ORIGINAL AND PERSONAL</string>
    <string name="sinArticleContent">The first humans God created, Adam and Eve, sinned by disobeying God. In the same way, sin which is the failure to follow the good and perfect will of God for us touches not only one human but has been touching all humans at a personal level. It was the first \'original sin\' of Adam and Eve, but also became personal as each of us committed sin. The image of the apple eaten on both sides reminds us of this fact, that there is Adam\'s original sin and our personal sin. By disobeying God, humans rejected the life-giving relationship with God, and death entered the world in consequence of sin.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_atonement_article">AtonementArticleActivity</string>
    <string name="atonementArticleContent">The name ‘Jesus’ means \'God saves.\' When Jesus was born, about 2000 years ago, He came to deliver all humanity from the slavery of sin. If Jesus Christ was fully God, He was also fully human except that He never disobeyed His heavenly Father. Jesus loved us so much that He gave His life for us, dying on the cross. The fully obedient life of Christ and His death on the cross are the grounds of our salvation so that we can be united with God again. The cross represents that sin is already crushed and opens the possibility of being delivered from sin to aholy life. The cross is empty, without the body of the dying Jesus, because three days after His death on the cross, Jesus was resurrected - proving His victory over sin and death.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_prevenient_grace_article">PrevenientGraceArticleActivity</string>
    <string name="atonementArticleTitle">VI. ATONEMENT</string>
    <string name="prevenientGraceArticleTitle">VII. PREVENIENT GRACE</string>
    <string name="prevenientGraceArticleContent">Grace means \'gift\'. A gift from God. \'Prevenient grace\' means \'the gift that comes before,\' that precedes our good intentions. If humans have been enslaved to sin from the days of Adam until now, it means that since Adam sinned we were not capable on our own of pure and righteous motives and actions. The prevenient grace of God is the gift that comes before us to convince us of sin and enables us to turn from sin to righteousness, from evil to God. The picture represents a gift in a box, ready to be opened. As it is for prevenient grace, we need to open this gift by opening our hearts to the direction God wants for us, in order to be delivered from sin and death.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_repentance_article">RepentanceArticleActivity</string>
    <string name="repentanceArticleTitle">VIII: REPENTANCE</string>
    <string name="repentanceArticleContent">Repentance is a sincere change of mind in regard to sin, involving a sense of personal guilt and a voluntary turning away from sin. The picture of a returning arrow shows that repentance involves a real change of attitude, with the humble hope of God\'s mercy. Repentance is a necessary step toward God\'s forgiveness. The picture of the arrow goes from 7 to 9, showing that repentance is possible only because of God\'s prevenient grace that makes us aware of our sins and leads us to hope in God\'s forgiveness and justification.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_just_regen_adopt">JustRegenAdoptActivity</string>
    <string name="justRegenAdoptArticleTitle">IX. JUSTIFICATION, REGENERATION AND ADOPTION</string>
    <string name="justRegenAdoptArticleContent">Justification is the gracious act of God by which He fully forgives all committed sins, and accepts as righteous all who believe in Jesus Christ, and receive Him as their Lord and Saviour. This act of God can be understood as three-fold: - Justification. The person is accepted as righteous through his/her faith in Jesus. The picture of the judge\'s gavel represents the judgment of God that graciously recognizes us as righteous and acquits us (Rom 3:21-26). - Regeneration or new birth. Through this gracious act of God, a new spiritual life is granted to the believer. The picture of the little baby shows that by the grace of God we become a new creation (John 3, 2Cor 5:17). - Adoption as child of God. The picture of a father welcoming his little child reminds us of this wonderful aspect of God\'s grace at work (Rom 8:15-17). Justification, regeneration and adoption are simultaneous in the experience of the one who seeks God and are obtained upon the condition of faith, preceded by repentance, and the Holy Spirit witnesses to the believer of this work and state of grace.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_entire_sanctification_article">
        EntireSanctificationArticleActivity
    </string>
    <string name="entireSanctificationArticleTitle">X. ENTIRE SANCTIFICATION</string>
    <string name="entireSanctificationArticleContent">Entire sanctification is the act of God, after regeneration, by which believers are released from original sin. It is preceded by an entire consecration of the believer to follow God wherever He wills, and the Holy Spirit bears witness to this work and state of grace. A sanctified person will be released from the self-centeredness that is still often felt after justification, and will walk faithfully and obediently as a servant of God. If it is possible to enter into this state of grace for all believers, it is also possible to fall from it. The life of holiness is possible only through following Christ with all our heart and strength, a walk of faith that brings to Christlikeness of character and personality. The dove inside the heart expresses the fact that entire sanctification can be described as the fullness of the Spirit or as loving God with all of our heart, mind and soul; and loving our neighbour as ourselves .</string>

        ArticlesFiveToTenReviewArticle
    </string>
    <string name="articlesFiveToTenReviewTitle">REVIEW ARTICLES 5 TO 10</string>
    <string name="reviewArticlesFiveToTenContent">The original sin, image 5 was like a trap that needed the help of someone outside of us to be broken. This is what Jesus did through the atonement, image 6. In order to benefit from this and be united with God, we humans needed the help of God who through prevenient grace image 7, makes us aware of our wickedness and of our need of God\'s help. Thanks to God\'s prevenient grace we realized our need to repent image 8, and to welcome with obedient faith Jesus as our Lord and Savior in order to be reconciled with God as His forgiven children image 9. From this blessed adoption we are led by the Holy spirit toward the joy of a life of purity fully surrendered to God, filled with the Spirit and thus entirely sanctified, image 10.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_the_church_article">TheChurchArticleActivity</string>
    <string name="theChurchArticleTitle">XI. THE CHURCH</string>
    <string name="theChurchArticleContent">The Church is the community that confesses Jesus Christ as Lord, the covenant people of God made new in Christ. The Body of Christ called together by the Holy Spirit through the Word of God. The Lord calls the believers in the Church to worship together and to be a shining witness of His love to the world, inviting unbelievers to the joy of being a redeemed child of God and thus part of His family. The church is represented by the image of exterior walls. Although the church is not at all a building but a living community of believers united to God through Jesus. If you look at each brick, you will see that it is \'made of persons,\' to express that we, as members of the church are to be living stones that are connected together and welcome God to reign in our midst and shine through us. In the top-left corner of the building, you can see that there is a missing brick and this is to remind us that the church is not \'the others,\' but it is of fundamental importance that we each become a part of it, thus filling this gap and bringing all our gifts to the service of God in the Christian community.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_baptism">BaptismActivity</string>
    <string name="baptismArticleTitle">XII. BAPTISM</string>
    <string name="baptismArticleContent">Our Lord gave us the command to baptize new believers in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. To be baptized, we have to confess our faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. We must have the purpose of obediently following God for a life of love, righteousness and holiness. Baptism is the first sacrament that a believer is invited to experience, thus becoming a member of the church of our gracious and righteous God. The picture shows someone being immersed into water by a servant of God, showing one example of how someone can be baptized.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_lords_supper">LordsSupperActivity</string>
    <string name="lordsSupperArticleTitle">XIII. THE LORD\'S SUPPER</string>
    <string name="lordsSupperContent">Following the commandment of our Lord Jesus, we commemorate Jesus\' sacrifice for each of us through the Lord\'s Supper. Like baptism, the Lord\'s Supper is a sacrament. It requires faith in Christ and love for the saints. The Lord\'s Supper has two parts. His body which was broken for us on the cross is represented by the bread and His blood which was poured out for the forgiveness of our sins is represented by the cup.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_divine_healing">DivineHealingActivity</string>
    <string name="divineHealingContent">We believe that God can heal our bodies in many ways. One of them is through direct divine intervention; another is through doctors and medicine. The picture shows someone praying God near a sick person, thus stressing the fact that prayer is a key element in asking for divine healing.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_the_end_times">TheEndTimesActivity</string>
    <string name="theEndTimesArticleTitle">THE END TIMES</string>
    <string name="theEndTimesContent">The final section relates to the End Times. We are now on the last group of articles. A group showing two key foundations for our faith, which can be great incentives to welcome Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour. The Second coming of Christ and the Resurrection, judgment and destiny, are intimately linked.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_second_coming">SecondComingActivity</string>
    <string name="secondComingOfChrist">XV. SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</string>
    <string name="secondComingContent">As He has promised to His disciples, Jesus will come again. His coming will bring the final judgment humans. The picture is showing Jesus as coming from heaven.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_ress_judg_dest_article">RessJudgDestArticleActivity</string>
    <string name="resurrectionJudgDestArticleTitle">XVI. RESURRECTION, JUDGMENT AND DESTINY</string>
    <string name="resurrectionJudgDestContent">At the second coming of Jesus, the dead will resurrect and be judged. Those who have put their faith in Jesus Christ and have done good will be raised to resurrection of life. And those who have rejected Jesus Christ and done evil to a resurrection of damnation. Therefore, resurrection, judgment and destiny will be intimately linked together. The first picture shows someone resurrecting, the second one above, the gavel, expresses the judgment and the last two pictures illustrate the two possible destinies: hell represented by fire for those condemned for having rejected Christ and having done evil in their lives, and the angel welcoming at the gates of heaven suggests the blessed destiny of those who have believed in the work of Jesus Christ and done what is good.</string>
    <string name="title_activity_review_of_articles">ReviewOfArticlesActivity</string>
    <string name="reviewArticlesTitle">REVIEW OF ARTICLES OF FAITH</string>
    <string name="reviewArticlesContent">Now, as you finish this study of the articles of faith, make sure you remember the title of these two articles, particularly the three parts of the title of article 16. You can notice that 15-16 are located just below 8-10, because when Jesus will come back it will be too late for going through steps 8-10 (repentance, justification and entire sanctification). Therefore the time for repenting and believing in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour is now, since we won\'t have the opportunity when Jesus will come back. And that time could be even TODAY! Each of us must be ready by repenting of our sins trusting in the work of Jesus Christ and following Him obediently as Lord and Savior.</string>

    <string name="triuneGodInfo"> 1. We believe in one eternally existent, infinite God, Sovereign Creator and Sustainer of the universe; that He only is God, [creative and administrative,] holy in nature, attributes, and purpose[;]. The God who is holy love and light [that He, as God,] is Triune in essential being, revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (Genesis 1; Leviticus 19:2; Deuteronomy 6:4-5; Isaiah 5:16; 6:1-7; 40:18-31; Matthew 3:16-17; 28:19-20; John 14:6-27; 1 Corinthians 8:6; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Galatians 4:4-6; Ephesians 2:13-18; 1 John 1:5; 4:8)</string>
    <string name="jesusChristInfo">2. We believe in Jesus Christ, the Second Person of the Triune Godhead; that He was eternally one with the Father; that He became incarnate by the Holy Spirit and was born of the Virgin Mary, so that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say the Godhead and manhood, are thus united in one Person very God and very man, the God-man. We believe that Jesus Christ died for our sins, and that He truly arose from the dead and took again His body, together with all things appertaining to the perfection of man’s nature, wherewith He ascended into heaven and is there engaged in intercession for us.\n\n(Matthew 1:20-25; 16:15-16; Luke 1:26-35; John 1:1-18; Acts 2:22-36; Romans 8:3, 32-34; Galatians 4:4-5; Philippians 2:5-11; Colossians 1:12-22; 1 Timothy 6:14-16; Hebrews 1:1-5; 7:22-28; 9:24-28; 1 John 1:1-3; 4:2-3, 15)</string>
    <string name="holySpiritInfo">3. We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Third Person of the Triune Godhead, that He is ever present and efficiently active in and with the Church of Christ, convincing the world of sin, regenerating those who repent and believe, sanctifying believers, and guiding into all truth as it is in Jesus.\n\n(John 7:39; 14:15-18, 26; 16:7-15; Acts 2:33; 15:8-9; Romans 8:1-27; Galatians 3:1-14; 4:6; Ephesians 3:14-21; 1 Thessalonians 4:7-8; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 1 Peter 1:2; 1 John 3:24; 4:13)</string>
    <string name="holyScripturesInfo">4. We believe in the plenary inspiration of the Holy Scriptures, by which we understand the 66 books of the Old and New Testaments, given by divine inspiration, inerrantly revealing the will of God concerning us in all things necessary to our salvation, so that whatever is not contained therein is not to be enjoined as an article of faith.\n\n(Luke 24:44-47; John 10:35; 1 Corinthians 15:3-4; 2 Timothy 3:15-17; 1 Peter 1:10-12; 2 Peter 1:20-21)</string>
    <string name="sinInfo">5. We believe that sin came into the world through the disobedience of our first parents, and death by sin. We believe that sin is of two kinds: original sin or depravity, and actual or personal sin.\n\n5.1. We believe that original sin, or depravity, is that corruption of the nature of all the offspring of Adam by reason of which everyone is very far gone from original righteousness or the pure state of our first parents at the time of their creation, is averse to God, is without spiritual life, and inclined to evil, and that continually. We further believe that original sin continues to exist with the new life of the regenerate, until the heart is fully cleansed by the baptism with the Holy Spirit.\n\n5.2. We believe that original sin differs from actual sin in that it constitutes an inherited propensity to actual sin for which no one is accountable until its divinely provided remedy is neglected or rejected.\n\n5.3. We believe that actual or personal sin is a voluntary violation of a known law of God by a morally responsible person. It is therefore not to be confused with involuntary and inescapable shortcomings, infirmities, faults, mistakes, failures, or other deviations from a standard of perfect conduct that are the residual effects of the Fall. However, such innocent effects do not include attitudes or responses contrary to the spirit of Christ, which may properly be called sins of the spirit. We believe that personal sin is primarily and essentially a violation of the law of love; and that in relation to Christ sin may be defined as unbelief.\n\n(Original sin: Genesis 3; 6:5; Job 15:14; Psalm 51:5; Jeremiah 17:9-10; Mark 7:21-23; Romans 1:18-25; 5:12-14; 7:1-8:9; 1 Corinthians 3:1-4; Galatians 5:16-25; 1 John 1:7-8) (Personal sin: Matthew 22:36-40 {with 1 John 3:4}; John 8:34-36; 16:8-9; Romans 3:23; 6:15-23; 8:18-24; 14:23; 1 John 1:9-2:4; 3:7-10)</string>
    <string name="atonementInfo">6. We believe that Jesus Christ, by His sufferings, by the shedding of His own blood, and by His death on the Cross, made a full atonement for all human sin, and that this Atonement is the only ground of salvation, and that it is sufficient for every individual of Adam’s race. The Atonement is graciously efficacious for the salvation of [the irresponsible] those incapable of moral responsibility and for the children in innocency but is efficacious for the salvation of those who reach the age of responsibility only when they repent and believe.\n\n(Isaiah 53:5-6, 11; Mark 10:45; Luke 24:46-48; John 1:29; 3:14-17; Acts 4:10-12; Romans 3:21-26; 4:17-25; 5:6-21; 1 Corinthians 6:20; 2 Corinthians 5:14-21; Galatians 1:3-4; 3:13-14; Colossians 1:19-23; 1 Timothy 2:3-6; Titus 2:11-14; Hebrews 2:9; 9:11-14; 13:12; 1 Peter 1:18-21; 2:19-25; 1 John 2:1-2)</string>
    <string name="prevenientGraceInfo">7. We believe that the human race’s creation in Godlikeness included ability to choose between right and wrong, and that thus human beings were made morally responsible; that through the fall of Adam they became depraved so that they cannot now turn and prepare themselves by their own natural strength and works to faith and calling upon God. But we also believe that the grace of God through Jesus Christ is freely bestowed upon all people, enabling all who will to turn from sin to righteousness, believe on Jesus Christ for pardon and cleansing from sin, and follow good works pleasing and acceptable in His sight. We believe that all persons, though in the possession of the experience of regeneration and entire sanctification, may fall from grace and apostatize and, unless they repent of their sins, be hopelessly and eternally lost.\n\n(Godlikeness and moral responsibility: Genesis 1:26-27; 2:16-17; Deuteronomy 28:1-2; 30:19; Joshua 24:15; Psalm 8:3-5; Isaiah 1:8-10; Jeremiah 31:29-30; Ezekiel 18:1-4; Micah 6:8; Romans 1:19-20; 2:1-16; 14:7-12; Galatians 6:7-8)\n\n(Natural inability: Job 14:4; 15:14; Psalms 14:1-4; 51:5; John 3:6a; Romans 3:10-12; 5:12-14, 20a; 7:14-25)\n\n(Free grace and works of faith: Ezekiel 18:25-26; John 1:12-13; 3:6b; Acts 5:31; Romans 5:6-8, 18; 6:15-16, 23; 10:6-8; 11:22; 1 Corinthians 2:9-14; 10:1-12; 2 Corinthians 5:18-19; Galatians 5:6; Ephesians 2:8-10; Philippians 2:12-13; Colossians 1:21-23; 2 Timothy 4:10a; Titus 2:11-14; Hebrews 2:1-3; 3:12-15; 6:4-6; 10:26-31; James 2:18-22; 2 Peter 1:10-11; 2:20-22)</string>
    <string name="repentanceInfo">8. We believe that repentance, which is a sincere and thorough change of the mind in regard to sin, involving a sense of personal guilt and a voluntary turning away from sin, is demanded of all who have by act or purpose become sinners against God. The Spirit of God gives to all who will repent the gracious help of penitence of heart and hope of mercy, that they may believe unto pardon and spiritual life.\n\n(2 Chronicles 7:14; Psalms 32:5-6; 51:1-17; Isaiah 55:6-7; Jeremiah 3:12-14; Ezekiel 18:30-32; 33:14-16; Mark 1:14-15; Luke 3:1-14; 13:1-5; 18:9-14; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:31; 17:30-31; 26:16-18; Romans 2:4; 2 Corinthians 7:8-11; 1 Thessalonians 1:9; 2 Peter 3:9)</string>
    <string name="justRegenAdoptInfo">9. We believe that justification is the gracious and judicial act of God by which He grants full pardon of all guilt and complete release from the penalty of sins committed, and acceptance as righteous, to all who believe on Jesus Christ and receive Him as Lord and Savior.\n\n10. We believe that regeneration, or the new birth, is that gracious work of God whereby the moral nature of the repentant believer is spiritually quickened and given a distinctively spiritual life, capable of faith, love, and obedience.\n\n11. We believe that adoption is that gracious act of God by which the justified and regenerated believer is constituted a son of God.\n\n12. We believe that justification, regeneration, and adoption are simultaneous in the experience of seekers after God and are obtained upon the condition of faith, preceded by repentance; and that to this work and state of grace the Holy Spirit bears witness.\n\n(Luke 18:14; John 1:12-13; 3:3-8; 5:24; Acts 13:39; Romans 1:17; 3:21-26, 28; 4:5-9, 17-25; 5:1, 16-19; 6:4; 7:6; 8:1, 15-17; 1 Corinthians 1:30; 6:11; 2 Corinthians 5:17-21; Galatians 2:16-21; 3:1-14, 26; 4:4-7; Ephesians 1:6-7; 2:1, 4-5; Philippians 3:3-9; Colossians 2:13; Titus 3:4-7; 1 Peter 1:23; 1 John 1:9; 3:1-2, 9; 4:7; 5:1, 9-13, 18)</string>
    <string name="entireSanctificationInfo">[Christian Holiness and Entire Sanctification]\n\n13. We believe that [entire] sanctification is [that] the [act] work of God[, subsequent to regeneration, by] which transforms believers into the likeness of Christ. It is wrought by God’s grace through the Holy Spirit in initial sanctification, or regeneration (simultaneous with justification), entire sanctification, and the continued perfecting work of the Holy Spirit culminating in glorification. In glorification we are fully conformed to the image of the Son. We believe that entire sanctification is that act of God, subsequent to regeneration, by which believers are made free from original sin, or depravity, and brought into a state of entire devotement to God, and the holy obedience of love made perfect. It is wrought by the baptism with or infilling of the Holy Spirit, and comprehends in one experience the cleansing of the heart from sin and the abiding, indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, empowering the believer for life and service. Entire sanctification is provided by the blood of Jesus, is wrought instantaneously by grace through faith, preceded by entire consecration; and to this work and state of grace the Holy Spirit bears witness. This experience is also known by various terms representing its different phases, such as “Christian perfection,” “perfect love,” “heart purity,” “the baptism with or infilling of the Holy Spirit,” “the fullness of the blessing,” and “Christian holiness.”\n\n14. We believe that there is a marked distinction between a pure heart and a mature character. The former is obtained in an instant, the result of entire sanctification; the latter is the result of growth in grace. We believe that the grace of entire sanctification includes the divine impulse to grow in grace as a Christlike disciple. However, this impulse must be consciously nurtured, and careful attention given to the requisites and processes of spiritual development and improvement in Christlikeness of character and personality. Without such purposeful endeavor, one’s witness may be impaired and the grace itself frustrated and ultimately lost. Participating in the means of grace, especially the fellowship, disciplines, and sacraments of the Church, believers grow in grace and in wholehearted love to God and neighbor.\n\n(Jeremiah 31:31-34; Ezekiel 36:25-27; Malachi 3:2-3; Matthew 3:11-12; Luke 3:16-17; John 7:37-39; 14:15-23; 17:6-20; Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 15:8-9; Romans 6:11-13, 19; 8:1-4, 8-14; 12:1-2; 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; Galatians 2:20; 5:16-25; Ephesians 3:14-21; 5:17-18, 25-27; Philippians 3:10-15; Colossians 3:1-17; 1 Thessalonians 5:23-24; Hebrews 4:9-11; 10:10-17; 12:1-2; 13:12; 1 John 1:7, 9)\n\n(“Christian perfection,” “perfect love”: Deuteronomy 30:6; Matthew 5:43-48; 22:37-40; Romans 12:9-21; 13:8-10; 1 Corinthians 13; Philippians 3:10-15; Hebrews 6:1; 1 John 4:17-18 “Heart purity”: Matthew 5:8; Acts 15:8-9; 1 Peter 1:22; 1 John 3:3 “Baptism with or infilling of the Holy Spirit”: Jeremiah 31:31-34; Ezekiel 36:25-27; Malachi 3:2-3; Matthew 3:11-12; Luke 3:16-17; Acts 1:5; 2:1-4; 15:8-9 “Fullness of the blessing”: Romans 15:29 “Christian holiness”: Matthew 5:1-7:29; John 15:1-11; Romans 12:1-15:3; 2 Corinthians 7:1; Ephesians 4:17-5:20; Philippians 1:9-11; 3:12-15; Colossians 2:20-3:17; 1 Thessalonians 3:13; 4:7-8; 5:23; 2 Timothy 2:19-22; Hebrews 10:19-25; 12:14; 13:20-21; 1 Peter 1:15-16; 2 Peter 1:1-11; 3:18; Jude 20-21)</string>
    <string name="churchInfo">15. We believe in the Church, the community that confesses Jesus Christ as Lord, the covenant people of God made new in Christ, the Body of Christ called together by the Holy Spirit through the Word. God calls the Church to express its life in the unity and fellowship of the Spirit; in worship through the preaching of the Word, observance of the sacraments, and ministry in His name; by obedience to Christ, holy living, and mutual accountability. The mission of the Church in the world is to [continue] share in the redemptive and reconciling ministry [work] of Christ in the power of the Spirit [through holy living, evangelism, discipleship, and service]. The Church fulfills its mission by making disciples through evangelism, education, showing compassion, working for justice, and bearing witness to the kingdom of God.\n\nThe Church is a historical reality, which organizes itself in culturally conditioned forms; exists both as local congregations and as a universal body; sets apart persons called of God for specific ministries. God calls the Church to live under His rule in anticipation of the consummation at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n(Exodus 19:3; Jeremiah 31:33; Matthew 8:11; 10:7; 16:13-19, 24; 18:15-20; 28:19-20; John 17:14-26; 20:21-23; Acts 1:7-8; 2:32-47; 6:1-2; 13:1;14:23; Romans 2:28-29; 4:16; 10:9-15; 11:13-32; 12:1-8; 15:1-3; 1 Corinthians 3:5-9; 7:17; 11:1, 17-33; 12:3, 12-31; 14:26-40; 2 Corinthians 5:11-6:1; Galatians 5:6, 13-14; 6:1-5, 15; Ephesians 4:1-17; 5:25-27; Philippians 2:1-16; 1 Thessalonians 4:1-12; 1 Timothy 4:13; Hebrews 10:19-25; 1 Peter 1:1-2, 13; 2:4-12, 21; 4:1-2, 10-11; 1 John 4:17; Jude 24; Revelation 5:9-10)</string>
    <string name="baptismInfo">16. We believe that Christian baptism, commanded by our Lord, is a sacrament signifying acceptance of the benefits of the atonement of Jesus Christ, to be administered to believers and declarative of their faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior, and full purpose of obedience in holiness and righteousness. Baptism being a symbol of the new covenant, young children may be baptized, upon request of parents or guardians who shall give assurance for them of necessary Christian training. Baptism may be administered by sprinkling, pouring, or immersion, according to the choice of the applicant.\n\n(Matthew 3:1-7; 28:16-20; Acts 2:37-41; 8:35-39; 10:44-48; 16:29-34; 19:1-6; Romans 6:3-4; Galatians 3:26-28; Colossians 2:12; 1 Peter 3:18-22)</string>
    <string name="lordsSupperInfo">17. We believe that the Memorial and Communion Supper instituted by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ is essentially a New Testament sacrament, declarative of His sacrificial death, through the merits of which believers have life and salvation and promise of all spiritual blessings in Christ. It is distinctively for those who are prepared for reverent appreciation of its significance, and by it they show forth the Lord’s death till He come again. It being the Communion feast, only those who have faith in Christ and love for the saints should be called to participate therein.\n\n(Exodus 12:1-14; Matthew 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; Luke 22:17-20; John 6:28-58; 1 Corinthians 10:14-21; 11:23-32)</string>
    <string name="divineHealingInfo">18. We believe in the Bible doctrine of divine healing and urge our people to seek to offer the prayer of faith for the healing of the sick. We also believe God heals through the means of medical science.\n\n(2 Kings 5:1-19; Psalm 103:1-5; Matthew 4:23-24; 9:18-35; John 4:46-54; Acts 5:12-16; 9:32-42; 14:8-15; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11; 2 Corinthians 12:7-10; James 5:13-16)</string>
    <string name="secondComingInfo">19. We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ will come again; that we who are alive at His coming shall not precede them that are asleep in Christ Jesus; but that, if we are abiding in Him, we shall be caught up with the risen saints to meet the Lord in the air, so that we shall ever be with the Lord.\n\n(Matthew 25:31-46; John 14:1-3; Acts 1:9-11; Philippians 3:20-21; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18; Titus 2:11-14; Hebrews 9:26-28; 2 Peter 3:3-15; Revelation 1:7-8; 22:7-20)</string>
    <string name="resuJudgeDestInfo">20. We believe in the resurrection of the dead, that the bodies both of the just and of the unjust shall be raised to life and united with their spirits—“they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.”\n\n21. We believe in future judgment in which every person shall appear before God to be judged according to his or her deeds in this life.\n\n22. We believe that glorious and everlasting life is assured to all who savingly believe in, and obediently follow, Jesus Christ our Lord; and that the finally impenitent shall suffer eternally in hell.\n\n(Genesis 18:25; 1 Samuel 2:10; Psalm 50:6; Isaiah 26:19; Daniel 12:2-3; Matthew 25:31-46; Mark 9:43-48; Luke 16:19-31; 20:27-38; John 3:16-18; 5:25-29; 11:21-27; Acts 17:30-31; Romans 2:1-16; 14:7-12; 1 Corinthians 15:12-58; 2 Corinthians 5:10; 2 Thessalonians 1:5-10; Revelation 20:11-15; 22:1-15)</string>
